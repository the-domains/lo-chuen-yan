  I’m a vocational mobile programmer and web developer in Hong Kong. I studied
  Electronic and Computer with the Software Engineering Group Project Contest
  2015 Champion awarded. This is a interesting subject for me. During my studies
  I have held different freelance programming jobs to enhance and practice my
  programming knowledge and I have demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility
  and learned the importance of teamwork. I am a conscientious person who works
  hard and pays attention to detail. I am flexible, quick to pick up new skills
  and eager to learn from others. I also have experience in learning and
  excelling at new technologies as needed. Until then, I’m enjoying lift day by
  day in this oddly beautiful city and taking in everything it has to offer.
